An Android application that captures a subset of the information presented on the 
https://livetraffic.com web site but in a form more easily digested on a mobile device.

This is the very first Android app I ever wrote, which I have converted from Java to Kotlin 
as a learning exercise.

## Libraries
The app makes use of these libraries:
* Android Annotations 
* Dagger
